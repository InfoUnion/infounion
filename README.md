# Branching Protocol

Whenever you are working on a new branch remember to checkout that branch. Don't make changes on the main branch. Once you are done with the issue at hand, create a new pull request. Copy a link and a message into the discord for someone to review the pull request. Anyone can review anyone else's pull request. If it's been a couple of days and no one has reviewed your pull request yet, choose a specific person and ask them to review your request.

If someone asks you to review their request or you see a message for a request review, try to make time to do it in a timely manner.
